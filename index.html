        <h3 id="head">About us</h3><br><br>

        <p>Petco is a category-defining health and wellness company focused on improving the lives of pets,<br>
        pet parents and our own Petco partners. Since our founding in 1965, we've been trailblazing new<br>
        standards in pet care, delivering comprehensive wellness solutions through our products and <br>
        services, and creating communities that deepen the pet-pet parent bond. <br><br>

        We employ more than 29,000 partners nationwide and operate more than 1,500 Petco locations across<br>
        the U.S., Mexico and Puerto Rico — including a growing network of more than 200 in-store <br>
        veterinary hospitals — and offer a complete online resource for pet health and wellness at <br>
        petco.com and on the Petco app. <br><br>
            
        In tandem with Petco Love, an independent nonprofit organization, we have helped find homes for <br>
        more than 7 million animals through in-store adoption events.</p><br><br><br>
